## Courses
* [Creating Accessible Websites](https://www.udemy.com/share/101MTn3@bgLnmNfel5HRBoJS1canOGjJb8rYXHYAj2czdivLY0jaCV52E8AUChFP2K4dOGD_Iw==/) by [Stefany Newman](https://stefanywebdesign.info/)
   - This is a front-end development focused course on how to make websites accessible through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The course also covers how to test and audit your website's accessibility through color contrast checking, keyboard navigation, screen readers, zoom testing, and automated validation.

* [How to Design for Accessibility: for UX Designers](https://www.udemy.com/share/103Xsa3@6fXVmrNv8B4YoMSB_k9V2TQm0rCJ2tF3j6W--LvhFvIzZTIwGn4Yo0VYaf1E0AbKuQ==/) by [Liz Brown](https://linktr.ee/LizBrownUX)
   - This course is focused purely on creating accessibile interfaces in the design phase.  The course follows WCAG 2.2 guidelines and covers best practices to use when designing elements such as links, buttons, data visualizations, etc. to make them color-independent and easily readable to colorblind and visually impaired users.  I appreciate that the instructor emphasizes that an accessible design does not equal an ugly design, and the instructor also notes different variations and things to consider to ensure the design remains accessible while adhering to a company's branding.  

## Downloads
* [NVDA Screen Reader](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/) by [NV Access](https://www.nvaccess.org/)
   - This screen reader is free to download, and I've found the NVDA reader easy to toggle on and off so that I can frequently test my projects during development.
